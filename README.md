ðŸ“Š Netflix Data Analysis with Matplotlib

This project explores the Netflix dataset using Matplotlib to visualize different aspects of TV shows and movies. The goal is to gain insights into Netflixâ€™s content distribution across types, ratings, durations, release years, and countries.

ðŸ“‚ Contents

Dataset: Netflix dataset (CSV file)

Tools Used:

Python

Matplotlib

Pandas

ðŸ“ˆ Visualizations
1. TV Shows vs Movies (Bar Graph)

Compares the count of TV Shows and Movies available on Netflix.

2. Ratings Distribution (Pie Chart)

A pie chart showing the percentage of different ratings (like TV-MA, TV-14, R, etc.).

3. Movie Duration (Histogram)

Histogram illustrating the distribution of movie durations (in minutes).

4. Release Year vs Number of Movies (Scatter Plot)

Scatter plot showing how the number of movies released has changed over time.

5. Top 10 Countries (Bar Graph)

Shows the top 10 countries with the most content on Netflix.

ðŸš€ How to Run

Clone this repository:

git clone https://github.com/sahilarora-1/Netflix-analysis-using-matplotlib-.git

Install dependencies:

pip install pandas matplotlib


Open the Jupyter Notebook or Python file and run the analysis:

jupyter notebook

ðŸ“Œ Insights

Netflix has more movies than TV shows, but TV shows are growing steadily.

TV-MA and TV-14 are the most common ratings.

Most movies have a duration between 80â€“120 minutes.

The majority of movies were released between 2010â€“2020.

The United States, India, and the UK are among the top contributors of content.

ðŸŽ¯ Conclusion

This project demonstrates how Matplotlib visualizations can reveal hidden patterns in Netflixâ€™s content library. Future work could include using Seaborn or Plotly for advanced visualizations and applying machine learning for deeper insights.
